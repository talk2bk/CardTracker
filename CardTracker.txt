add option to search for a card to add to a user
your user account screen has:
	an add button
	a list of cards you have in your possession (borrowed)
	(maybe add a list of cards you own, that'd be huge nuts)
	
when you click on create a card you are prompted for:
	1. a card name (for now)
	2. a drop down of current users (or type in a name)



Each person is an object
	name
	array of cards that they have
each card is an object
	card name
	original owner


ISSUES:
seems like quickly adding in cards is gonna be difficult or awkward
	probably needs a quick way to find users and cards.
	global database of *unique* users (like usernames) required.
	having one person create a "im borrowing this card object" should create it as well in the respective person's "cards being borrowed" list.

solution to creating cards: during creation prompt for original and current owner. default both to the current user.

adding cards:


how it works:
each user keeps track of what cards they have currently.
	easier to deal with, since we have a database of users we can skim to look up who has what.
each card keeps track of it's original owner and current owner.

when looking up:
cards you are borrowing:
	look in the current user's collection

cards you own that are being borrowed:
	look through every user for your cards? seems too slow.
	should we have a database of all the cards? no also too slow on a larger scale.
	everytime someone borrows a card from you or oyu borrow from them, have the user keep track of these other users for faster lookup? seems good. more work though.

all cards(cards you are bororwing and being borrowed):
	just do both operations.




the future:
*have an option to add make a borrowed card now a card that belongs to the borrowed(like a trade happened)
*unique ids?
*allow cardtracker to load preexisting databases, sinec there will be multiple maybe
