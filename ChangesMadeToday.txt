look up using scryfall api.

TODO: 
ADD A DATABASE

update equals method in my card
fix search to search for name and unfold results

to do autocompleting searches using scryfall:
rest api: cards/autocomplete and return the list and do that everytime they enter a letter.

(maybe not, since requires user accounts)
{
*adding card, add to currentowner's collection. 
*adding card, while loop to look for users?
*maybe when adding card, print a list of users out and choose one to use.
}

*give each user a unique ID
*default when adding cards to have original and current owners be the current user.
*give cards or take cards from other people. trade screen?
*add magic card api to this so it can look up real magic cards.
*add autocomplete and things like that.
*solidify word choices for cards being borrowed and cards you are borrowing so shit is less confusing.
*lookup other user and "link" it when you add a new card
	when you create a card, set original and current owners.
	(do i need to add this card to other people's collections? since they are in someone else's collection right now, they wouldnt show up in the originalowner's collections.)
	(probably just add it to the current owner's collection. need to make the card link to each unique owner though.)
*do checks when adding a card if that user exists or not. probably need to make it a while loop.
*need to fix adding a card in the future, definitely broken
