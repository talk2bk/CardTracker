put in unit tests(still currently inoperable)
to update database functions:
update loadDatabase to access mongoDB(query collections)
update savedatabase to save to mongodb collections
to update other methods:
	require look up of that user in teh database.
	after each operation, save the changes in teh database.
		(will eventually need to implement a fix for multiple simultaneous user access)
	
changed it from keeping track of all card info to just keepign track of scryfall ids
	
TODO: 
refactor card handling:
	each card keeps track of a unique ID instead of all the card info. can pull info when needed.




ADD A DATABASE
mongodb:
database (full thing)
	table(collection) - a grouping of all users
		tuple/row(document) - a single user in teh document
			column(field) - an attribute of the user
(need to convert my objects into gson/json parsable objects)

to do autocompleting searches using scryfall:
rest api: cards/autocomplete and return the list and do that everytime they enter a letter.

(maybe not, since requires user accounts)
{
*adding card, add to currentowner's collection. 
*adding card, while loop to look for users?
*maybe when adding card, print a list of users out and choose one to use.
}

*give each user a unique ID
*default when adding cards to have original and current owners be the current user.
*give cards or take cards from other people. trade screen?
*add magic card api to this so it can look up real magic cards.
*add autocomplete and things like that.
*solidify word choices for cards being borrowed and cards you are borrowing so shit is less confusing.
*lookup other user and "link" it when you add a new card
	when you create a card, set original and current owners.
	(do i need to add this card to other people's collections? since they are in someone else's collection right now, they wouldnt show up in the originalowner's collections.)
	(probably just add it to the current owner's collection. need to make the card link to each unique owner though.)
*do checks when adding a card if that user exists or not. probably need to make it a while loop.
*need to fix adding a card in the future, definitely broken
