*login loop is now a while
*added resetdatabase for testing purposes
*added displayusers for testing purposes.

TODO: 
*give each user a unique ID
*default when adding cards to have original and current owners be the current user.
*give cards or take cards from other people. trade screen?
*add magic card api to this so it can look up real magic cards.
*add autocomplete and things like that.
*solidify word choices for cards being borrowed and cards you are borrowing so shit is less confusing.
*lookup other user and "link" it when you add a new card
	when you create a card, set original and current owners.
	(do i need to add this card to other people's collections? since they are in someone else's collection right now, they wouldnt show up in the originalowner's collections.)
	(probably just add it to the current owner's collection. need to make the card link to each unique owner though.)
*do checks when adding a card if that user exists or not. probably need to make it a while loop.
